# Computer, Enhance! Performance Aware Programming Course

## As of now
This repo has my C 8086 decoder with 8086 simulation added.
I opted to use Casey's reference decoder for the later work.

## Building
My stuff is just a single translation unit C compile.

For the reference decoder as a shared/dynamic library, in addition to Casey's `build.bat` for Windows, I created [my own `build.sh` for building the equivalent on Mac](https://github.com/wavecommander/perfaware/blob/master/computer_enhance/perfaware/sim86/build.sh).
